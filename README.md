Online GTD tool, tree notes and to-do list management system

The MyWorkState.com is a web-based notes and to-do list and task management system, storage of text and image notes in hierarchical format, a GTD tool. It is designed for technical people, especially for one-man-company software developers (ISVs, independent software vendors). 
The software is developed and used by me to efficiently develop multiple software projects, organize my thoughts, make plans, do brainstorming. I have developed MyWorkState.com for myself for bug tracking, project planning, brainstorming, book and diary writing, as CRM and CMS system. The tree structure reflects structure of my own memory and thoughts. The software helps me to extend my memory - increase number of things I am able to handle. I would like to share it with you, if you are interested.
Efficiency
With the MyWorkState.com software I have improved my efficiency:
I spend 5..20 hours per week for StarTrinity SIP Tester product, mostly for development of new features. The product is being used by more than 300 customers around the world
I develop a new feature in 1..5 days
I fix a bug in 1..12 hours
It takes 5..30 minutes to review and reprioritize all current tasks
I have about 2000 thoughts/tasks/items stored in the system, I can access any item in few seconds

INSTRUCTIONS:
* open project in VS2017
* project "Organizer.Database" - file "Organizer.Database.publish.xml" - edit connection string to MSSQL server (default is localhost\SQLEXPRESS), click publish. It creates database and tables.
* project "Organizer.web" - file "Web.config" - "connectionStrings" section - edit connection string for "OrganizerEntities"
* Run project "Organizer.web", sign up, log in, edit root tree item
* Publish the project to your own server, set up automatic database backups (there are some free tools to back up MSSQL if you ask google)
* My contacts: asv@startrinity.com, skype: asv128
* Enjoy having your thoughts/tasks organized hierarchically, it is natural way how it works I think
