    <h3>StarTrinity Organizer. Online GTD tool, tree notes and to-do list management system</h3>
    The StarTrinity Organizer is an open source web-based notes and to-do list and task management system, storage of text and image notes in hierarchical format, a GTD tool.
    It is designed for technical people, especially for one-man-company software developers (ISVs, independent software vendors).
    <br/>
    The software is developed and used by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sergey-a/17/980/824">me</a> to efficiently develop multiple software projects, organize my thoughts, make plans, do brainstorming.
    I have developed the Organizer for myself for bug tracking, project planning, brainstorming, book and diary writing, as CRM and CMS system. 
    The tree structure reflects structure of my own memory and thoughts. The software helps me to extend my memory - increase number of things I am able to handle.
    I would like to share it with you, if you are interested.
